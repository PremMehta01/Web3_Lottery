1. User can enter lottery with ETH based on USD fee
2. An admin will choose when the lottery is over. <!-- Since we have admin here so this is not 100% decentralized application though we can make it via other way -->
3. The lottery will select a random winner.


How will we test this?

1. `mainnet-fork`
2. `development` with mocks
3. `testnet`
